# Go

Go is a general purpose programming language that was developed at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go was designed around the concept of concurrency which is the "composition of independently executing processes" and is "about dealing with lots of things at once". In contrast parallelism is "the simultaneous execution of computations" and "about doing lots of things at once". (The Go Blog - https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)
